It contextualises every technique learnt. But why is it true? How do we visualise it outside of abstract proofs?\n$$F(x) = \\int_a^x{f(t)dt}$$\nCar Analogy\nPerhaps the easiest explanation is one involving a somewhat ________ situation. Consider that you are driving along a highway, and would like to know how far you have travelled in a particular time period. For this situation, there are no street signs or navigation systems - only the dashboard in front of you.\nSo let’s say every 10 seconds you look at your speed. In that 10 seconds, we can calculate how far you would have travelled:\n$$\nv = \\frac{d}{\\Delta t}\\\\\nd = v\\Delta t\n$$\nBut that’s only for ten seconds. We would need to sum up all the time intervals to get a total distance:\n$$\nd_{tot} = \\sum v\\Delta t\n$$\nGreat, now we have an estimate for the total distance. But this estimate isn’t very good; it assumes our speed is constant within the 10 second intervals. But a lot can happen in that time; we can speed up to overtake, slow down for traffic, etc. So we should try to reduce the time interval as much as possible. We know that within calculus, this is modelled as a limit. Thus we could express our total distance as:\n$$\nd_{tot} = \\lim\\limits_{\\Delta t\\to 0} \\sum v\\Delta t\n$$\nWhat we have is just integration from first principles. Thus we can replace it with:\n$$\nd_{tot} = \\int v\\ dt\n$$\nAnd therefore, distance is the integral of velocity with respect to time. We know that velocity is the derivative of distance with respect to time, so we have proven that indeed derivatives and integrals are inverses.\nA way to visualise it\nWe can flesh this out with a bit of visualisation. Imagine what would happen if you speed up by $5\\ m/s$ instantaneously, from $5\\ m/s$ to $10\\ m/s$. The $v(t)$ graph would sharply increase. But your distance travelled would not sharply increase; rather, for every second after this change, your distance will increase by 10 m, rather than 5 m. In other words, the slope of the distance graph will increase. This makes sense as the area under the curve of the velocity graph does not sharply increase at this point; it just increases faster than it did before.\nVelocity\n\nDistance\n\n"},"7":{"title":"Maths Extension 1","id":"mathsext1/","text":"Maths Extension 1\n\nHow to do a u-substitution\n\n"},"8":{"title":"Integration by Substitution","id":"mathsext1/usub/","text":"How to do a u-substitution\nWithin the realm of integration, all techniques can be understood in terms of their differentiation counterparts. U-substitutions are no different, but the technique of which it is the inverse may not be immediately obvious. It is in fact the inverse chain rule, which we will explain below.\nProof\nThe chain rule can be summarised as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f’(g(x)) \\times g’(x)\n$$\nThe nested functions can be confusing, so think of the $f’(g(x))$ as differentiating the outer function $f(x)$ with respect to the inner function $g(x)$. As an example:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} sin(x^2)\n$$\nWe will differentiate the sine function with respect to $x^2$, giving $cos(x^2)$, and then we will multiply by $2x$:\n$$\n= cos(x^2) \\times 2x\n$$\nThis is important for u-substitution. Let’s consider integrating both sides of the chain rule expression:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) \\ dx = \\int f’(g(x)) \\times g’(x) \\ dx\n$$\nLeft hand side is an integral of a derivative, which just cancels down to $f(g(x))$. Switching LHS and RHS:\n$$\n\\int f’(g(x)) \\times g’(x) \\ dx = f(g(x))\n$$\nAnd this is our u-substitution expression. We can see that to integrate a nested function, we need the derivative of the inside function $g’(x)$ on the end.\nTo make things easier, we will substitute $u = g(x)$ when we solve questions like this; this is where the technique gets its name. But when we substitute $u$, we need to also substitute $du$, as we must integrate functions in terms of $u$ with respect to $u$, not $x$. This is done as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq1}\n\\begin{split}\ng’(x) &amp; = \\frac{d}{dx}u \\\\\ng’(x)dx &amp; = du\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\nSo thus our $du$ will ‘swallow up’ the derivative function $g’(x)$. Once we are in terms of $u$, we can integrate like any other function:\n$$\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq2}\n\\begin{split}\n\\int f’(u)du &amp; = f(u) + C\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\nWe can then finally substitute $u = g(x)$ back in to our answer, to get it in terms of $x$:\n$$\nf(u) + C = f(g(x)) + C\n$$\nExample\nLets consider:\n$$\n\\int xcos(x^2)dx\n$$\nAs we have nested functions, we will integrate by u-substitution. When we determine what to set $u$ to be, we must consider that we must have its derivative on the outside (remember that $g’(x)$ on the end). So let’s set it to be $x^2$:\n$$\n\\text{Let}\\ u = x^2\n$$\nNow we need to calculate the derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq3}\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{du}{dx} &amp; = 2x \\\\\nxdx &amp;= \\frac{1}{2}\\ du\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\nAnd finally we can substitute in to get a new integral in terms of $u$:\n$$\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq4}\n\\begin{split}\n&amp; \\int \\frac{1}{2}cos(u)du \\\\\n&amp; = \\frac{1}{2}sin(u) + C \\\\\n&amp; = \\frac{1}{2}sin(x^2) + C\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\nA word about bounds\nThis is where most students go wrong. If we have a definite integral (one which lower and upper bounds), we must write these in terms of $u$ as well. To do this, we subsitute the bounds for $x$ into our $u(x)$ function (the statement in which we let $u$ be some function of $x$) to compute our new bounds.\nFor example, if the previous integral was actually:\n$$\n\\int^2_1 xcos(x^2)dx\n$$\nOur new bounds would be, based on the statement $u = x^2$:\n$$\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq5}\n\\begin{split}\n\\text{Upper} = 2^2 = 4 \\\\\n\\text{Lower} = 1^2 = 1\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\nSo our integral in terms of $u$ is now:\n$$\n\\int^4_1 \\frac{1}{2}cos(u)du \\\\\n$$\n"},"9":{"title":"Maths Extension 2","id":"mathsext2/","text":"Maths Extension 2\nComing soon!\n"},"10":{"title":"Physics","id":"physics/","text":"Physics\n\nLife Cycle of a Star: Summary\n\n"},"11":{"title":"Life Cycle of a Star: Summary","id":"physics/starlifesummary/","text":"Life Cycle of a Star: Summary\nDepending on their mass while within the main sequence, stars will undergo different transitions as they progress through their life.

For example, smaller stars will expel their mass less forcefully when they exhaust their fuel supply; a planetary nebula will result.
