# Life Cycle of a Star: Summary

Depending on their mass while within the **main sequence**, stars will undergo different transitions as they progress through their life. This is the result of differences in *gravitational force* and *nuclear fusion pressure* (the stellar 'tug-of-war') caused by variations in mass and density. For example, smaller stars will expel their mass less forcefully when they exhaust their fuel supply; a **planetary nebula** will result. Larger stars will undergo this process violently, resulting in a **supernova**.

All the relevant stages are summarised below in this handy graphic, serving as an excellent summary for this area of Module 8.
